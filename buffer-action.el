;;; Commentary:

;; Perform actions(compile, run) based on buffer properties, such as major
;; mode, filename or any lisp expressions.  e.g.,

;;   foo.c: M-x buffer-action-compile => "gcc -o foo foo.c -O2"
;;          M-x buffer-action-run => "./foo"

;; What kind of shell commands or lisp expressions to call for each
;; action(compile/run) is configurable through `buffer-action-table'.

;; To use, add this file to your load-path and the following to your
;; .emacs:
;;       (autoload 'buffer-action-compile "buffer-action")
;;       (autoload 'buffer-action-run "buffer-action")

;;; History

;; This is a mostly rewritten based on ideas from Seiji Zenitani
;; <zenitani@mac.com>'s `smart-compile.el'. Besides compile action, i've add a
;; run action, and also extend buffer-action-table to accept more formats when
;; configuring a match.

;;; TODO

;; - Recognize Makefile in a directory, so don't bother me when calling
;;   the compile command from different file buffers, which all belongs
;;   to the same directory.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))
